            <h1>Website Accessibility Statement</h1>
            <p>We recognise the importance of providing a website that is accessible by all users. We are aware that some people with disabilities find using the internet difficult and we also know that many sites do not accommodate those with visual or other disabilities. With this foremost in our mind we have tried our very best to make this website as accessible as possible. An accessible website ensures that all visitors have the same user experience whether they use assisting technology or not. VIT4u Limited website meets the level 1 (and in part level 2) of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C&#39;s</abbr> (Web Accessibility Initiative) Standards &amp; Guidelines for creating accessible websites and the W3C Guidelines for correct <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> markup.</p>

        	<p>The VIT4u Limited website has been optimised for and tested on the following Web Browsers; Microsoft Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9 (Windows), Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Google Chrome.</p>
      		<p>The following features to ensure the best use of our site by all of our users;</p>        	
        	
        	<h2>Structural Markup</h2>
        	<p>Web pages on www.vit4u.co.uk include 4 different navigational areas:</p>
        	<ol>
            	<li>The top-level site navigation bar</li>
            	<li>The left-side sub-navigation bar</li>
            	<li>Hyperlinks within the body of each page</li>
            	<li>The website footer</li>
        	</ol>
        	<p>When CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are turned off by the browser or not applied to a document (when using a screen reader or some mobile devices for example), the 3 areas are displayed in the above order.</p>

        	
        	<h4>Images</h4>

            	<li>The first link in every document is &quot;Skip Navigation&quot;; which allows users to skip directly to what is considered the main section of the page (the content).

            	<li>URL&#39;s are permanent whenever possible</li>
        	</ol>
